Note: When declaring a View, options, el, tagName, id and className may be defined as functions, if you want their values to be determined at runtime

[Models]
Each model in Backbone has an id

Models also have a cid (client id) which is automatically generated by Backbone when the model is created'.   it is helpful when you donâ€™t have a true id

The idAttribute is the identifying attribute name of the model returned from the server (i.e., the id in your database)

[Views]
El is the central property of a view.

There are two ways to associate a DOM element with a view: a new element can be created for the view and subsequently added to the DOM or a reference can be made to an element which already exists in the page.

Apply existing Backbone view's to a different DOM elements by using setElement.  setElement will create a cached $el reference for you, moving the delegated events for a view from the old element to the new one.

Backbone.Model
Backbone.View
Backbone.Collection


Functions:
.on
.add
.reset
.set
.get
.setElement
.trigger
.once

model.toJSON();

Collection.set - Takes a collection of models and performs CRUD.
Collection.reset - Replaces entire contents of collection (Doesn't fire any events).

console.log(JSON.stringify(items.toJSON()));

# backbone
This project is a collection of examples that I've created while reading and learning about Backbone.js.  

While these examples have been created by me (with the help of the sources I've learned from), anybody is obviously free to use them.  If using/downloading these examples, please understand they haven't been tested to be correct.

As always, please report any errors/fixes to me and I will gladly correct them (or fork, and do it yourself).
